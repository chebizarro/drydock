# Drydock

Automated code review for [NIP-34](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/34.md) Nostr repositories. Drydock listens for patch and pull request events on Nostr relays, reviews them with local LLMs, and publishes structured review comments back to the protocol.

## How It Works

```
Nostr Relays ──subscribe──▶ Listener ──▶ Ingest ──▶ Pipeline Workers
                                                        │
                                         ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐

                                                                       │
                                                                       ▼
Nostr Relays ◀──publish──────────────────────────────── Publisher (kind 1111)
```

Drydock subscribes to NIP-34 event kinds (patches, PRs, repository announcements, status updates). When a new patch arrives, it clones the referenced repository, builds a deterministic context bundle within a 64K token budget, routes the patch through a planner→reviewer LLM pipeline, and publishes structured kind 1111 review comments. A meta-review loop evaluates review quality and feeds improvements back into the system.

All inference runs locally via OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM). No code leaves your infrastructure.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/user/drydock.git && cd drydock
go build ./...

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set your signing identity and LLM endpoints

# Run
go run ./cmd/drydock
```

See [Deployment](docs/deployment.md) for Docker, multi-GPU, and production setups.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Go | 1.26+ | `CGO_ENABLED=0` — no C toolchain needed |
| Git | any | Used at runtime for clone, fetch, grep |
| Ollama (or compatible) | any | OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint |

## Configuration

All configuration is via `DRYDOCK_*` environment variables. See the full reference: **[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)**

Key settings:
- `DRYDOCK_SIGNER_BUNKER_URL` or `DRYDOCK_SIGNER_NSEC` — Nostr signing identity
- `DRYDOCK_RELAYS` — comma-separated relay URLs
- `DRYDOCK_PLANNER_BASE_URL`, `DRYDOCK_LLM70B_BASE_URL`, etc. — LLM endpoints
